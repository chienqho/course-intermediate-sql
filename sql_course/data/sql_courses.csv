We will dive into using machine learning for ranking;content understanding;and query understanding;along with how to use embeddings;dense vectors and deep learning to improve retrieval and ranking.,Machine Learning,A,2017-10-24 15:46:00,6,83.0,2,61
996,Fundamentals of Data Modeling,This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of data modeling for modern data warehouses. We use the Kimball dimensional model to guide us;but that does not mean this class is all theory! We have designed this course so you will learn the theory behind data modeling (normalization / denormalization;star schemas;fact and dimension tables) and you will build actual models using real world data. We will use plain SQL so you can do modeling whether you only have access to SQL or you are using a tool like dbt. By the end of this course;you will have a deep understanding of dimensional modeling;and you will have built one from scratch.,Data Engineering,B,2018-04-10 23:09:00,3,168.0,4,82
997,Natural Language Processing,Build your own auto-compose tool and other projects while learning key NLP concepts such as BERT;entity recognition;intent classification;spacy;and Transformer models powering search engines like Google or voice assistants like Google Home or Amazon Alexa.,Language Processing,B,2017-06-16 14:58:00,3,191.0,4,81
998,Advanced SQL,Over these four weeks;you will learn the advanced SQL kills necessary to dive into real datasets with confidence. We will clean up messy and nested data;learn about EAV schemas and pivots;and dive deep into advanced window functions. We will also cover performance;advanced joins;and other complex SQL patterns to optimize queries.,Data Engineering,A,2017-11-26 03:49:00,1,,2,64
